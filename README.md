# Social Network API

## Description

This project is a challenge of creating a social network api full or controllers, routes, and models using express and mongoose. This project has really helped me understand the logic behind each folder of the backend and will greatly help my knowledge in fullstack.

I had more fun on this than I thought I would, and I think this increase knowledge on APIs will help me create an incredible project in the future.

## Installation

To install the project, clone the repository onto your PC.
Enter the directory that has the cloned repository.



## Usage

To test the api routes, type "npm install" to download the express and mongoose packages.
then type "npm run dev" to start the local server.
Use Insomnia to test apis.
